The main topics intelligent infrastructure, cloud
computing and public security challenge the IT security of the
future. In addition to the classical term of security one has to deal
with threats from the inside as well. It is not enough anymore only to
look at security issues of system components. We have to focus on
transdisciplinary methods. The Kompetenzzentrum f√ºr Angewandte
Sicherheits-TEchnoLogie (KASTEL) is a research center for cyber
security and combine several areas of IT security and their users.
