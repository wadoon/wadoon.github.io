The vision for this project is to advance technology such that
regression verification methods are available that will be routinely
used for ensuring correctness in the evolution processes for
long-living reliable systems requiring frequent re-validation. The
goal of regression verification is to formally prove that software
remains correct through its evolution, changes have the desired
effect, and no new bugs are introduced. Regression verification avoids
the main bottleneck for the routine practical use of formal
verification, namely the need to write full functional specifications
(which is a huge effort). Also, given two program versions or variants
that are both complex but similar to each other, the effort for
verifying the relation between them mainly depends on the difference
between the programs and not on their overall size and complexity.
