The KeY System is a formal software development tool that aims to
integrate design, implementation, formal specification, and formal
verification of object-oriented software as seamlessly as possible. At
the core of the system is a novel theorem prover for the first-order
Dynamic Logic for Java with a user-friendly graphical interface. The
project was started in November 1998 at the University of
Karlsruhe. It is now a joint project of KIT, Chalmers University of
Technology, Gothenburg, and TU Darmstadt. The KeY tool is available
for download.
