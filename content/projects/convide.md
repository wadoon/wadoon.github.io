At the Collaborative Research Center 1608 "Consistency in the View-Based
Development of Cyber-Physical Systems", researchers with a background in
computer science, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering join forces
to create solutions designed to tackle the immense complexity of current and
future cyber-physical systems (CPS). We are developing a methodology for CPS
across various design spaces of different engineering disciplines ensuring short
release cycles, high dependability, and high configurability. Following our
vision will enable us to formulate a new role of software engineering as an
exporter of methods within systems engineering.
