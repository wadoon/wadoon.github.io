All project partners of the SofDCar Alliance are focussing their research on the challenges of future E/E & SW architecture in vehicles.

Each vehicle is seen as one piece in a network of all vehicles and the infrastructure. Its integration will be enabled via “data loops” and new-type “digital twins”, thereby paving the path to digital sustainability (of today’s and tomorrow’s vehicle generations) and enabling efficient data structures and innovative use cases throughout the whole vehicle lifetime (Re-Deployment). 

This project is part of a government-sponsored research program. It is sponsored by the German Ministry of Business Affairs and Climate Control (BMWK).
