Reliably Secure Software Systems – RS³ In recent years tremendous
progress has been achieved in formal verification of functional
properties of computer programs. At the same time seminal papers have
been published showing that it is in principle possible to formulate
information-flow problems as proof obligations in program logics. The
overall goal of the project is to leverage these advances together
with our own experience in formal methods for functional properties in
order to specify and verify security properties. DeduSec Project
