In the information age, computers are a key driver in all areas of
research, technology, business, and society.  Therefore, high-quality
software, hardware, and AI models are necessary to maintain digital
sovereignty and need provisional research. Currently, research on core
informatics, i.e. research on fundamental methods of informatics that
can be applied in various applications and domains, is a blind spot in
the Helmholtz Association, which has informatics research but mainly
weaved into their specific classical research area.

Through the Pilot Program Kerninformatik am KIT (KiKIT), the research
on core informatics is to become a focus of Helmholtz research. KiKIT
focuses on the research of novel general methods in the fields of
algorithm and software engineering,
data analysis, and machine learning as well as
hardware and network systems.
Moreover, KiKIT pursues the goal of providing stable research tools
(research software, AI models, etc.) to accelerate other research
activities within Helmholtz as well as to support innovation in
industry.

Currently, there are 26 PIs, and 40 researchers in 36 projects working
on topics like Sustainability, Correctness, Explainability, and
Performance of Software and Hardware following the goal of
strengthening Germany's sovereignty in informatics.
