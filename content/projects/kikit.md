In the information age, computers are a key driver in all areas of research,
technology, business, and society. Therefore, high-quality software, hardware,
and AI models are necessary to maintain digital sovereignty and need provisional
research. Through the Pilot Program Kerninformatik am KIT (KiKIT), the research
on core informatics is to become a focus of Helmholtz research. KiKIT focuses on
the research of novel general methods in the fields of algorithm and software
engineering, data analysis, and machine learning as well as hardware and network
systems. Moreover, KiKIT pursues the goal of providing stable research tools
(research software, AI models, etc.) to accelerate other research activities
within Helmholtz as well as to support innovation in industry.
