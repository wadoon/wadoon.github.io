Depending on the industrial sector, an automated Production Systems (aPS, i.e.,
machines and plants) are subject to strict regulations, which affect changes
made to an aPS during or after commissioning and start-up. In sectors affected
by legal regulations, e.g., the medical field, changes must be documented in
standardized change tracking workflows to prevent undesired side effects.
Certain change types or scopes even require a complex recertification process.
Instead of going through test executions again, regression verification with
appropriate specifications would support shortening and partially automating the
revalidation processes and provide documentation to ensure the software's
behavior is as intended.
