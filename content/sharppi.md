### #PI â€” Quantified Information Flow of C programs
sharpPI is a tool for quantified information flow analysis with
support Shannon Entropy based on the SAT-based approach of Vladimir
Klebanov.

QIF with sharpPI has following features:

* applicable for the C language
* support Shannon entropy (counts images and pre-images)
* deterministic and non-deterministic programs
* bounds calculation
