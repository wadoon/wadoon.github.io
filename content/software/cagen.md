### CAgen â€” Full Refinement Approach for Design-by-Contract of Reactive System in C

`cagen` is a prototypical helper for the work with contract automata. 

This program offers you the construction of proof obligations based on a system description and contract automata. 
There are different proof obligations. 

We recommend you to use [nuXmv](https://nuxmv.fkb.eu), [cbmc](https://www.cprover.org/cbmc/) and [seahorn](https://github.com/seahorn/seahorn).
