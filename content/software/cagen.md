`cagen` is a helper for the work with contract automata. This program offers you
the construction of proof obligations based on a system description and contract
automata. There are different proof obligations.

It reduce the proof obligations into inputs for [nuXmv](https://nuxmv.fkb.eu),
[cbmc](https://www.cprover.org/cbmc/) and
[seahorn](https://github.com/seahorn/seahorn).
